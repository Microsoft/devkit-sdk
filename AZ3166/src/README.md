# MXChip IoT DevKit

The MXChip IoT DevKit (a.k.a DevKit) is used to develop and prototype Internet of Things (IoT) solutions leveraging Microsoft Azure services. It includes an Arduino compatible board with rich peripherals and sensors, an open-source board package and a growing projects catalog.

With DevKit, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Arduino Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) to rapidly build a full-fledged IoT application that integrates multiple services like Azure IoT Hub, Logic Apps and Cognitive Services.

The DevKit board features ARM Cortex-M processors. At its core, it comes with a SoC module that combines the power of the ST Microelectronics [STM32F412](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/group0/4f/7b/2b/bd/04/b3/49/25/DM00180369/files/DM00180369.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00180369.pdf) processor and Cypress [BCM43362](http://www.cypress.com/file/297991/download) for WiFi. For on-board peripherals, it has an OLED screen, headphone and speaker output, stereo microphone and abundant sensors such as humidity & temperature, pressure, motion (accelerometer & gyroscope) and magnetometer.
